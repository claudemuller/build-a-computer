## Unit 1.1 - Boolean Logic
  - Commutative Law
    ```
    (x AND y) = (y AND x)
    (x OR y) = (y OR x)
    ```
  - Associative Law
    ```
    (x AND (y AND z)) = ((x AND y) AND z)
    (x OR (y OR z)) = ((x OR y) OR z)
    ```
  - Distributive Law
    ```
    (x AND (y OR z)) = (x AND y) OR (x AND z)
    (x OR (y AND z)) = (x OR y) AND (x OR z)
    ```
  - De Morgan Law
    ```
    NOT(x AND y) = NOT(x) OR NOT(y)
    NOT(x OR y) = NOT(x) AND NOT(y)
    ```
  - Idempotence Law
    ```
    NOT(x) AND NOT(x) = NOT(x)
    ```
  - Double Negation Law
    ```
    NOT(NOT(x)) = x
    ```
